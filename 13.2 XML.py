# Elements (or Nodes)

# simple:
# 
# '<name>Chuck</name>'
# 
# complex:
# 
# '<person>'
#     '<name>Noah</name>'
# '<person>'

# Primary purpose is to help share structured data
# 
# Simplified subset of SGML

# XML Basics:
# 
# start tag - < >
# 
# end tag - </ then >
# 
# text content - Chuck, 7243034456
# 
# attribute - hide = 'yes'   or type = 'intl'
# 
# self closing tag - < then />

# White Space
# 
# line ends dont matter, whitespace is discarded
# 
# indented only to be readable

# Terminology:
# 
# Tags - beginning and ending of elements
# 
# Attributes - keyword/value pairs on the opening tag
# 
# Serialize/De-Serialize - convert data in one program into a common format that can be stored / transmitted between systems in a programming language-independent manner

# XML as a tree - nodes that connect
# 
# text is child of node

# XML Schema
# 
# describing a 'contract' as to what is acceptable XML
