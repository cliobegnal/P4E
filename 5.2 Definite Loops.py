# Definite loops have explicit iteration varaibles that change each time through the loop
#     
#     -these variables move through the sequence or set

# Looking at In...
# 
# the iteration variable 'iterates' through the sequence
# 
# the block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence
# 
# the iteration variable moves through all of the valuables in the sequence
